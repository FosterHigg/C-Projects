                                      *Project Write Up*

In this assignment, I will demonstrate the ability to write and apply C code to create a command-line game.

In this project, I am creating a game that helps a player feel like they are relaxing on a remote island.  
On this island, the player has the option to go fishing, go digging for rare gems, or take pictures while birdwatching.  
As an added bonus, the islandâ€™s local townsfolk will buy the fish, gems, or pictures that the player collects. 

The user must be able to select what activity to do, and must be able to perform the activity until they want to do something else.  
Since the activities rely more on luck and less on skill, you must use a random number generator that tells what the result of each activity is. 
For instance, if the player fishes 100 times, they might expect to catch a Snook 25 times. 

Regardless of activity, the player can only hold 5 items (fish, gems, or pictures) in their inventory.  
Once their inventory gets full, they must finish the current activity and sell what they have.  
Also, if a player wants to stop an activity at any time, then they must sell whatever items they have before moving to the next activity.  
When they are done with the entire program, the program must display how much money they received over the course of the entire game. 

Below are the outcome probabilities for each activity.
