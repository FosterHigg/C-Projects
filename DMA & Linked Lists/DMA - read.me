                                *Project Write Up*


In this assignment, I will demonstrate the ability to write and apply C code to create and process a linked list.

I will be taking a census of one neighborhood in Orlando. To do so, I want to implement a Linked List.  
In this assignment, I must use Dynamic Memory Allocation and the Linked List data structure.
In my census, i will be logging the last name of the family living in a given house, as well as how many people are living there. 
Then, when data for every house is entered, i will be able to tally the number of residents in the neighborhood.
